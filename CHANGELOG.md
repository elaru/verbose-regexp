# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Bump version to 1.0.0. Nothing changed really, but since I don't expect any design/API changes, I should have used this version number a year ago.
- Cosmetic changes to appease pana: Add analysis_options.yaml and CHANGELOG.md.
- Fix strong_mode and linter warnings.
- Update repository name in pubspec.yaml.

## 0.1.0

- Initial version.
